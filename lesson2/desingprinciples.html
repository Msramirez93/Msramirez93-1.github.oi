                <li>The Repetition<br>
                     is in the logo to be able to further promote the brand of the product, in this case promoting the soft drink that also has the same color combination with the contrast, part of this advertising is not only selling a soft drink but it is a way of showing you to the public that by consuming in this new ecological packaging they would be taking care of the environment, so the plastic used would reduce pollution is designed not only to consume their products but also to be able to reach a more ecological public.

                    We can see that on this page the filters are according to the
                    woman's wardrobe, although I selected this parameter it was to show
                    how within it we have more options to be able to continue filtering
                    until we get the product we are looking for since it allows us to
                    enter different categories and show your variety of products and
                    prices

                    <li>  Visual Hierarchy<br />
                        This website belongs to the tesla company in which we can see that
                        its visual hierarchy since when we enter its home page we can see
                        that its performance is the "model Y" of its cars when we select
                        that model to read about its references we can see what were its
                        modifications with respect to the model, but it is also observed
                        that in each part of the page there is the same button "order now"
                        so that users can obtain the product, in this case, the car.
